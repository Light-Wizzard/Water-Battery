# Water-Battery
Convert Water into Hydrogen &amp; Oxygen Converting that into Electricity to Charge a Battery

You can find more information about this project in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/Water-Battery/wiki)

This project will detail how to make a Fuel Cell using Water and Electrolysis using Electroids made with various materials, it will use a Carbon Fiber mat with infused Graphite, and other powered conductors. 

# How it works 
The process of Electrolysis is a well-known phenomenon, so I will try to explain it in terms most people will understand when you run a current through water, it will break down the water into its components, which are Oxygen &amp; Hydrogen, this is what I will call our First-Stage, and it has Second-Stage that converts the Oxygen &amp; Hydrogen into Electricity, this is also a well-known phenomenon and will talk more in detail in the Wiki about this, but this is the basic principles for how it works.

## Efficiency 
It takes energy to produce the Oxygen &amp; Hydrogen, so a Battery is required to store that Energy, I have decided on Litiumtaniate or LTO, it is safer than other types of batteries, and it takes energy to convert that Oxygen &amp; Hydrogen into Electricity, so it all comes down to Efficiency, can we make a Full Cell that is Efficient at charging a battery and keeping up with a load.

# Material required
I purchased my Graphite from a company called Graphite Sales, I did a lot of research into the type of Graphite I needed, and found this company to be the best supplier of Graphite Power used for Electroids in Metal Blasting Furness.

# Safety
Oxygen &amp; Hydrogen is very combustible, so you want to ensure you do not have anything that can ignite it near your work area, and you want to get equipment that is safe to use with Oxygen &amp; Hydrogen, and make sure you have a Static Strap on to prevent you from being the source of Ignition.

# Equipment

To set up a test bench, we need a Flowmeter that has a range starting from 0, the one I am looking at goes up to 3 Liters Per Minute, it is designed for Oxygen &amp; Hydrogen

We need a Flashback Arrestor rated for Oxygen &amp; Hydrogen, this will prevent a flame from traveling backwards but does not about the fire in front of it.

We need a Pressure Relief Valve rated for Oxygen &amp; Hydrogen, this is to prevent too much pressure from building up inside the chambers, and in case it should explode, it will vent that pressure, the one in the image below is a variable pressure valve, that should be sufficient for one cell

# Test Bench
You will want to make a bench, you can make it out of wood, plastic, aluminum, or about any other material you have available, but the best is to use extruded aluminum, and use Polycarbonate for all surfaces, make use it is grounded, and you have a Static wrist strap attached to it.

You want to fully enclose all sides and top, so when you are testing it, should it explode, you have a safety shield in place, and make sure if have a good vent tube, it should be at least 2 inches in diameter to allow it to safely vent in the case of an explosion.
