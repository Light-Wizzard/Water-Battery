# Water-Battery
Convert Water into Hydrogen &amp; Oxygen Converting that into Electricity to Charge a Battery

This project will detail how to make a Fuel Cell using Water and Electrolysis using Electroids made with various materials, it will use a Carbon Fiber mat with infused Graphite, and other powered conductors. 

I purchased my Graphite from a company called Graphite Sales, I did a lot of research into the type of Graphite I needed, and found this company to be the best supplier of Graphite Power used for Electroids in Metal Blasting Furness.
