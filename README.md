# Water-Battery
Convert Water into Hydrogen &amp; Oxygen Converting that into Electricity to Charge a Battery

You can find more informaton about this project in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/Water-Battery/wiki)

This project will detail how to make a Fuel Cell using Water and Electrolysis using Electroids made with various materials, it will use a Carbon Fiber mat with infused Graphite, and other powered conductors. 

I purchased my Graphite from a company called Graphite Sales, I did a lot of research into the type of Graphite I needed, and found this company to be the best supplier of Graphite Power used for Electroids in Metal Blasting Furness.

# Equipment

To set up a test bench, we need a Flowmeter that has a range starting from 0, the one I am looking at goes up to 3 Liters Per Minute, it is designed for Oxygen &amp; Hydrogen

We need a Flashback Arrestor rated for Oxygen &amp; Hydrogen

We need a Presurre Relief Valve rated for Oxygen &amp; Hydrogen

# Test Bench
You will want to make a bench, you can make it out of wood, plastic, aluminum, or about any other materal you have available, but the best is to use extruded alumium, and use Polycarbonate for all surfaces, make use it is grounded, and you have a Static wrist strap attached to it.
